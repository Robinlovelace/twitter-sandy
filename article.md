Analysis of Sandy Tweets paper
========================================================

## Introduction - Research questions

- What proportion of the population tweeted about Sandy in different areas? 
- Is the temporal distribution of Sandy tweets different from all tweets? 
- How does this vary by distance to the eye? (we need a 'control' datasets of tweets for comparison - do we have one?) 
- Are 'hurricane tweets' in affected areas most likely before, after or during the storm? 
- What proportion of tweets about Hurricane Sandy link to climate change?
- How do tweets in affected areas differ from those outside?

A bit on open code - make available on GitHub?
